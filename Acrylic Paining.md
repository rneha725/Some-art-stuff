- Soak brushes, do not let color stay on brush. Maybe use warm water.
- Don't use much water with the paint

### Things about Acrylic Paint
#### Goods:
- wide price range and a lot of colors
- Home friendly
- Easy
- Lots of education
- A lot of techniques - deep creativity
- Dries quick, can be removed with rubbing alcohol, mostly non-toxic

#### Bads
- Dries quickly - blending becomes difficult
- Disposie properly, for example do not drain the water directly to the sink, use a filter
- Temerature sensitive
- Paint oil on dry acrylic, not true opposite
- Brushes wear out faster - pH is very high
- Tons of misinformation

#### About the paint: 
- Pigment + Chemicals: emulsion: Each company has its own ratios of these
- Stabilizer so it dries under room temperature
- Amonia : pH (8 - 10), makes everything stable with time
- De-firmers
- Preservatives: stops micro-organisms
- Thickeners

#### Drying
- Once the paint is settled on canvas, water evaporates and the particles start to make structures together, it can introduce some porosity, not a big deal
- Varnishing can be added to beautify or address the porosity but not essentially needed.
- Thickness of the paint ~ time it will take to dry, then varnish.

#### Paint Levels
- 3 advanced, 2 artist, 1 student
- Use tools according to the level
- Craft bottle vs Artist paint: craft paint is the real paint.
- Student Greade - Lowest pigment to binder ratio, hue could be different than advanced, but they are in budget. More layers to cover an area. More shrinkage.
- Artist Grade - near to same pigment as advanced. Not pure pigment but quality is nice. Better rheology. Less shrinkage. Better milling than student.
- Advanced grade - Costly. Making is costly. Variety in colors, flow. Lower the number in series, the lower the cost. Higher the cost, pigment is harder to make.
